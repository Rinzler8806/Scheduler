**Scheduler Readme**

The purpose of this application is to add a dynamic scheduler that allows the user to document what they will need reminders for during the work day (9AM-5PM).
Additionally, the date will change in the header to reflect the current month/day/year.
The user can enter whatever activities they would like for a specific hour and then save these activities, so that they will be available if they choose to leave and come back to the page later on.
